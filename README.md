# **LeadBuckets Public Roadmap**

This issue-only repository is our public roadmap for LeadBuckets.co.

Add a new issue for feature requests, new integrations, bug reports, and general feedback.

Feel free to explore existing issues, leave comments, upvote issues, and add new issues. Issues have 5 levels of priority: `freezer` < `queued` < `prioritized` < `urgent` < `critical`. Issues can be a `bug`, `feature`, `integration`, or `enhancement`.

## **Report a Bug**

1. Search existing issues if your bug isn't already reported. Leave a comment and upvote with a thumbs up if it is.

   * Write a description as detailed as possible of what's wrong
   * Add screenshot(s) with the problematic area marked with red rectangles
   * Include your browser and operating system information
   * Add steps to reproduce the issue
   * Specify which lead source/integration was being used
